keyandmouse provides events and caching for key and mouse events.

There are several layers of abstraction:

- bottom keyboard layer is SdlKeyCache, which just stores sdl key codes
- bottom mouse layer is mousecache, which stores mouse position and button states

- next is KeyNameCache, which subscribes to both SDlKeyCache and MouseCache.
  It converts the keycodes and mousebutton codes into standardized, 
  implementation-independent keyname strings.  left mouse button becomes "leftmousebutton"
  
- KeyCombos subscribes to KeyNameCache.  It reads the key commands from the config class.
  Any time a combo matches, a down event is fired for that combo.  The combo stays down
  as long as those keys are pressed, even if additional keys are present.  When that
  combo is no longer pressed, an Up event is sent
  
- CommandCombos is the highest-level keyboard abstraction.  You can register a group
  of commands (from the config.xml).  These commands are mutually-exclusive, ie if
  a command matches, but another command matches, and matches better, only the second
  one will be considered down.

For mouse events, we have an additional abstraction:

- MouseMoveConfigMappings.  Abstracts mouse movement, so that the config file can
  map mouse up-down to vertical movement, but the config file could equally
  map the scrollwheel to vertical movement instead.

Note that Layer2MouseEvents is not currently either used or implemented
