v0.3.5 (SVN r184)
------
fixes:
- fixed bug in channel sync that caused duplicate exception
  (Closes sf.net bug #1064190)
- fixed tracking of ops and voices list on join
  (thanks to Clément Bourgeois, closes sf.net bug #1075942)
- fixed bug that the initial channel mode is not synced (on join). 
- fixed a crash bug in the channel sync code
  when a user was voiced/opped/banned 2 times, an ArgumentException was thrown
  (thanks to Clément Bourgeois for spotting this)
- fixed handling of a stalled connection
  IOException was not catched in the write thread, and in the read thread
  the IsConnectionError was not set
- fixed InviteEventArgs, mixed who with channel name
- fixed OnConnected event
  now it's raised when the connection is ready for sending data.
- fixed Reconnect() handling in the Listen() loop, moved to ReadLine().
- fixed InviteEventArgs.Channel property,
  initialized with the right value now.
- fixed nullref exception in _Event_QUIT()
  added sanity checks, FreshIRC network does very ugly things with the IRC
  protocol.

changes:
- improved handling of rejoining channels after reconnect.
- using keep-alive socket now.
- removed underscores in parameter names (violates .NET library standards)
- renamed parameters with "text" to different names
  (violates .NET library standards)
- using new case-insensitive hashtables (FxCop spotted this)
- improved the example/test program
- main bin/ directory is now used for the example programs
- changed overrides to new (method hiding is sufficient here).
- updated all MS VS.NET project files.

new:
- added Halfop support (with OnHalfop and OnDehalfop events)
  if you want to use it do:
  irc.NonRfcSupport = true;
  NonRfcChannel nchan = GetChannel("#channel");
  nchan.Halfops....
  or
  NonRfcChannelUser nuser = GetChannelUser("#channel", "nick");
  nuser.Halfop.....
- added Halfop() and Dehalfop() command to IrcCommands
- added OnErrorMessage event as general hook for all ERR_ messages
- added SendReply(), easy way of replying to a message
  (regardless if its a channel, query or notice message)
- added OnMotd event (with MotdEventArgs)
- added IrcClient.Motd property
- added OnChannelPassiveSynced event
- added channel sync timings to channels (Channel.ActiveSyncTime).
- added IrcClient.AutoRelogin setting.
- added IrcConnection.AutoRetryDelay property.
- added IrcConnection.OnConnectionError event.
- added Rfc2812.IsValidNickname() method.
- added IrcConnection.SocketSendTimeout and IrcConnection.SocketReceiveTimeout
- added little benchmark program (examples/benchmark).
- added stresstest program (examples/stresstest).
- added sign target to the makefile

v0.3.0 (SVN r123)
-------
fixes:
- fine tuned the "#ifdef LOG4NET" statements (thanks to prencher for noticing this
  log4net is fully optional! (only required for debugging the library)
- fixed bug, the class changed the Op and Voice list of a copy *boing*
  (FxCop pointed me to it)
- added check for "~" userflag on nameslist (thanks to Giacomo Di Ciocco)
  this broke the library on IRC networks using that userflag on channels
- fixed channel sync bug, when the connection is re-established
  (Closes sf.net bug #1043536)
- fixed rejoining channels when using Reconnect()
- added sanity checks in _Event_WHOREPLY()
  this will prevent exceptions when the IRC server voilates the RFC    
  (like some psybnc version do)
- fixed string handling in _Event_PRIVMSG() for CTCP messages
  (Closes sf.net bug #1039286)

changes:
- making SmartIrc4net CLS and .NET standards conform
  changed all delegates to use EventArgs
- made a few constructors "internal"
- directory struture changed
  the structure now represents the API layers
  (IrcConnection, IrcCommands and IrcClient)
- regex optimizations (thanks to prencher for the hints)
- renamed all ReplyCodes to conform to .NET standards
  (e.g. ReyplCode.RPL_Welcome -> ReplyCode.Welcome)
- renamed IrcConnection.Version to IrcConnection.VersionNumber
- renamed ChannelSync to ActiveChannelSync
  later I will introduce PassiveChannelSync, this means only the received
  data is used for channel sync no extra commands are send to the IRC server.

new:
- parts of SmartIrc4net have now XML documentation tags
- added *EventArgs for the events
- added exception handling for Connect() Reconnect() Disconnect()
- added VisualStudio project files (thanks to prencher for creating them)
- added constructors to the exception classes (.NET standards)
- added log calls for queue, when data could not be sent and is requeued
- added missing overloads for RFC commands (Closes sf.net bug #1061503)
  (Join, Part, Kick, List, Names) 
- added more RFC commands, now all RFC 2812 commands are implemented!
  (Oper, Motd, Luser, Version, Stats, Service, Squit, Links, Time, Connect,
   Trace, Admin, Info, Servlist, Squery, Whois, Whowas, Kill, Ping, Pong,
   Away, Rehash, Die, Restart, Summon, Users, Wallops, Userhost, Ison)
- WriteLine() will throw an NotConnectedException now when it's used without
  having a connection to an IRC server
- added timeout values for the tcp socket (6 minutes), and activated nodelay flag
- prefixed all IrcCommands that are actually plain RFC commands with "Rfc"
  e.g. Join() is now called RfcJoin()
