	 * The MAPPED-ADDRESS attribute indicates the mapped IP address and
	 * port.  It consists of an eight bit address family, and a sixteen bit
	 * port, followed by a fixed length value representing the IP address.

	 * The port is a network byte ordered representation of the mapped port.
	 * The address family is always 0x01, corresponding to IPv4.  The first
	 * 8 bits of the MAPPED-ADDRESS are ignored, for the purposes of
	 * aligning parameters on natural boundaries.  The IPv4 address is 32
	 * bits.
